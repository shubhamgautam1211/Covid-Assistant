# Description and Purpose of the Application 

#### During this Pandemic, people are not able to get general information about the ongoing cases and resources like Hospital details, vaccine details in a single interface. They are left in a dilemma about how to approach when they are affected with Covid, and so we have planned to provide all the information needed in this CovidAssistant Application itself, therefore saving people’s time and avoiding Panic in the crucial situation.


#### Whenever a new wave of Covid is approaching its end or is about to start, people get complacent about the safety protocols, and they start travelling carelessly because of which cases again rises up. The application will remind them to follow safety protocols at all times, and people will get to know about the number of cases in the city they are travelling to and therefore can plan beforehand about whether they should travel to the city or not.


#### We are also going to provide state wise general helpline numbers incase if people want to get any required information from government centers nearby.


# Tech Stack Used

`Visual Studio` `Flutter` `Dart` `JSON files` `Postman`

* #### So in order to get all cases of covid cases around the world, we have used available Postman API’s, and filtered it according to our needs for displaying in the home page.


* #### Now for getting details about the Covid Vaccine, we have fetched the data from the Cowin government site, and have computed algorithms and logics to map the vaccine data with particular pin code the user is searching for.


* #### For including the bottom navigation, we have used the curve navigation package available in the pub.dev site. Bottom navigation routes us to 3 tab bars, 1st one being Home dashboard, 2nd being Country details, and the 3rd one being contact info.
